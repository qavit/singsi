# SingSi.AI Development - Next Steps

## I. Highest Priority: Update Test Framework

1. **Update AI Service Unit Tests**
   - Create test cases for the `AIService` abstract interface
   - Complete tests for `OpenAIService` implementation
   - Build tests for the `create_ai_service` factory method
   - Test `DocumentAnalysisRequest` data class functionality
   - Create mock AI service responses for testing

2. **Update API Integration Tests**
   - Confirm AI API endpoints correctly use the new service architecture
   - Test dependency injection and configuration loading
   - Test asynchronous functionality and error handling

## II. AI Service Module Extensions

1. **Implement Prompt Management System**
   - Create `/app/utils/prompts.py` module
   - Design `PromptTemplate` class supporting variable substitution
   - Build prompt collections for different task types: document analysis, image description, question generation, etc.
   - Implement prompt version control mechanism

2. **Enhance Document Parsing Functionality**
   - Create document parsing strategy classes with appropriate third-party libraries:
     - PDF: `PyPDF2` or `pdfplumber`
     - Word: `python-docx`
     - Images: `pillow` + `pytesseract` (OCR)
   - Design structured models for parsing results
   - Integrate parsing results into the AI service workflow
   - **Incorporate Microsoft's Markitdown library**:
     - Configure OCR capabilities for image-based documents
     - Enable speech transcription for audio materials
     - Explore Azure Document Intelligence integration for advanced parsing
     - Set up LLM-based image description capabilities

3. **Complete AI Platform Support**
   - Implement `GeminiService` class
   - Provide specific unit tests for each AI service
   - Build model performance comparison mechanism

## III. Test Coverage & Quality Improvements

1. **Establish Automated Testing Workflow**
   - Configure `pytest` automated testing environment
   - Implement test data fixtures
   - Set up continuous integration testing

2. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Implement unified error handling mechanism
   - Add retry mechanism for AI service failures
   - Design more user-friendly error response formats

## IV. System Functionality Extensions

1. **Build Recommendation Engine Prototype**
   - Design recommendation data models
   - Implement simple content-based recommendation algorithms

2. **Begin Learning Analytics Functionality**
   - Design data collection mechanism
   - Establish basic statistical analysis functions

## V. Documentation & Deployment Updates

1. **Update Development & Deployment Documentation**
   - Update usage examples for key features
   - Complete `CONTRIBUTING.md` guide
   - Create simple demonstration videos

2. **Improve Development Environment**
   - Add pre-commit hooks
   - Configure basic CI workflow

## VI. Priority Recommendation

Prioritize the Prompt Management System and Document Parsing functionality, as these are foundational for further AI feature development. Next focus on test coverage to ensure implemented features are stable and reliable.

## VII. Advanced Media Processing

1. **Enable OCR for Educational Materials**
   - Add OCR processing for scanned textbooks and worksheets
   - Train or fine-tune OCR for mathematical notation and diagrams
   - Implement structure detection for form-like documents (worksheets, tests)

2. **Implement Audio Processing for Educational Content**
   - Set up speech-to-text conversion for lectures and presentations
   - Add language detection for multi-language support
   - Develop speaker identification for classroom discussions
   - Create timestamp-based navigation for audio content
