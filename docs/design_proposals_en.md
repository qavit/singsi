# Design Proposals and Directory Analysis

## 1. Module Design Overview

- Adopting Python 3.12 new features (e.g., pattern matching, type hints, f-strings) and PEP 8 style, with line length not exceeding 88 characters.
- Following SOLID principles and Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to separate responsibilities of functional modules.
- Technology and design patterns:
  - Dependency Injection (DI): Enhancing testability and extensibility.
  - Factory Pattern: Dynamically generating corresponding modules (e.g., AI, teaching material generation, assessment services) based on configuration.
  - Strategy Pattern: Applying different processing logic for document parsing, real-time interaction, grading, and other variable strategies.
  - Singleton Pattern: Ensuring single instances for globally shared services.
  - Deploying certain services as microservices for horizontal scaling.

### 1.1 AI Service Module
- Defining the AIService interface, implemented by various AI providers (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek),
  using the latest OpenAI SDK (2024+) and other corresponding SDKs.
- Supporting multi-modal tasks:
  - Natural Language Processing (e.g., document analysis, conversation generation)
  - Computer Vision (e.g., image analysis, image generation)
- Using DI and Factory Pattern to facilitate dynamic extension and error handling.

### 1.2 Document Analysis Module
- Responsible for parsing and managing various document formats (e.g., PDF, Word, images).
- Using Strategy Pattern to decouple parsing logic for different file formats, and separating parsing and post-processing layers.
  
### 1.3 Future Education Modules and Learning Analytics
- Teaching Material Generation Service:
  - Using AI models and template hybrid methods to generate lesson plans, handouts, assignments, and exams.
  - Adopting Factory Pattern to unify the creation of various material generators while using DI to manage dependencies.
- Learning Interaction and Assessment Module:
  - Supporting teacher-student interaction and automatic grading through real-time communication (WebSocket, async event streams).
  - Using Strategy Pattern to handle various question types and feedback.
- Learning Analytics Module:
  - Establishing data ETL processes to collect and process learning data, using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) for modular management.
  - Supporting data visualization dashboards and providing personalized learning recommendations.
- Knowledge Tracking and Adaptive Learning Module:
  - Combining recommendation systems and Reinforcement Learning technologies to dynamically adjust learning paths.
  - Adopting microservice architecture for distributed deployment, ensuring flexibility and high availability.

## 2. Multi-AI Platform Strategy
- Each AI platform can be incorporated into the project through independent implementations of the abstract AIService interface.
- Adding AIService factory module to dynamically create and centrally manage instances like OpenAIService, GeminiService, ClaudeService, and DeepSeekService.
- In the future, only implementations conforming to the AIService specification need to be added for new platforms.

## 3. Project Directory and File Naming Analysis

### 3.1 Directory Structure
- Overall layering is clear, with main directories as follows:
  - app/ — Core business logic and API-related files
  - docs/ — Documentation, design records, and requirement documents
  - tests/ — Unit and integration tests
- For future expansion, it is recommended to further plan the naming of utils/ and tasks/, for example:
  - Treating app/utils/ as helper modules, such as prompt management and shared tools.
  - Treating app/tasks/ as an asynchronous task area with semantically clear file names.

### 3.2 File Naming
- File names generally have semantic meaning, such as ai_service.py and project_structure.md.
- In case of confusion, it is recommended to add detailed file annotations for more generic names to facilitate maintenance.

## 4. Future Work Recommendations

- Develop detailed technical specifications and interface documents for various modules (parsers, interactive grading, AI services).
- Establish concrete unit and integration testing plans, specifying test cases and automated test scripts.
- Implement CI/CD processes, regularly executing automated tests, deployment verification, and performance monitoring.
- Conduct periodic system performance and stress tests, proposing optimization solutions for API and AI processing times.
- Adjust directory structure and file naming to improve readability and maintainability based on actual usage data and feedback.
