## Project Architecture

The project follows SOLID principles with a clean separation of concerns:
- Abstract interfaces define capabilities (e.g., `AIService`)
- Concrete implementations provide specific functionality (e.g., `OpenAIService`)
- Factory modules handle object creation and dependency injection
- Configuration is centralized and strongly typed using Pydantic

## Quick Start
